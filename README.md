# How did it all start?
 
October 2008. It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

<i>A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions <b>without central authority </b> through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other.

# The Blockchain Distributed Ledger  
  
<img src="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2-1.jpg">
<p> 
A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a network. The distributed ledger records the transactions, such as the exchange of assets or data, among the participants in the network.

Participants in the network govern and agree <b>by consensus</b> on the updates to the records in the ledger. <b>No central, third-party mediator, such as a financial institution or clearinghouse, is involved.</b>

Every record in the distributed ledger has a timestamp and unique crytographic signature, thus making the ledger an auditable history of all transactions in the network. One implementation of distributed ledger technology is the open source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

# Programming the Blockchain with Chaincode

<img src="chaincode.PNG">

http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/chaincode.html

Chaincode is a program, written in Go, node.js, and eventually in other programming languages such as Java, that implements a prescribed interface. Chaincode runs in a secured Docker container isolated from the endorsing peer process. Chaincode initializes and manages ledger state through transactions submitted by applications.

A chaincode typically handles business logic agreed to by members of the network, so it may be considered as a “smart contract”. State created by a chaincode is scoped exclusively to that chaincode and can’t be accessed directly by another chaincode. However, within the same network, given the appropriate permission a chaincode may invoke another chaincode to access its state.

Chaincode like <b> Stored Procedures </b> in Databases.

### [Consensus](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/blockchain/) 
 <p>Today, consensus protocols exist in many variations, but all of them need a majority or even a qualified majority (such as 2/3 of the nodes) to be correct, whereas the remaining ones could fail, misbehave, or even act adversarially against finding consensus.

Starting with the celebrated protocols for Byzantine Agreement established in 1982, consensus protocols have found widespread applications for keeping distributed systems healty and making cloud platforms operate continuously. </p>

It is also important to note the Hyperledger Fabric has HSM (Hardware Security Module) support which is vital for safeguarding and managing digital keys for strong authentication. Hyperledger Fabric provides modified and unmodified PKCS11 for key generation, which supports cases like identity management that need more protection.

## Channels
A Hyperledger Fabric channel is a private “subnet” of communication between two or more specific network members, for the purpose of conducting private and confidential transactions. 

## The Ledger and the State Database

There are two place which "store" data in Hyperledger Fabric:
### The ledger is the actual "blockchain". 
It is a file-based ledger which stores serialized blocks. Each block has one or more transactions. <br>
Each transaction contains a read-write set which modifies one or more key/value pairs. <br>
The ledger is the definitive source of data and is immutable.

### The state database holds the last known committed value for any given key. 
It is populated when each peer validates and commits a transaction. <br>
The state database can always be rebuilt from re-processing the ledger. <br>
There are currently two options for the state database: an embedded LevelDB or an external CouchDB.
<p>
As an aside, if you are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric channels, there is a separate ledger for each channel as well.
<p>
When we query from where do we retrieve data?  1) from the blockchain chain or 2) from state db? <p>.
If it is from state db how can it retrieve a specific key because you mentioned "state database holds the last known committed value for any given key" <p> 
Queries or GetState in chaincode return data from the state db. They will only return the last value for a key. <p>
If you want to get the entire history for a key, you need to enable the historical database in the configuration of your peer

# Designing and creating Blockchain applications with Hyperledger

## Step 1: Learn Design Thinking

[IBM Design Thinking Field Guide](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/12/ibm-design-thinking-field-guide/)

## Step 2: Go through IBM Blockchain Use Cases

[IBM Blockchain Use Cases](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/use-cases/)

## Step 3a: Take the IBM Blockchain on-line course

[Zero to Blockchain An IBM Redbooks course](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/crse0401.html)

## Step 3b: Go through selected Blockchain Developer Patterns
[Blockchain Developer Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/code/technologies/blockchain/)

## Step 4: Learn the Hyperledger Composer tool
[Hyperledger Composer Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/next/)

[Writing Your First Application](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/write_first_app.html?highlight=fabcar)

In Hyperledger Composer: save data model as a .bna file.

## Step 5: Deploy the business network to Hyperledger Fabric. 
* This requires the Hyperledger Composer chaincode to be installed on the peer,
* then the business network archive (.bna) must be sent to the peer, 
* and a new participant, identity, and associated card must be created to be the network administrator. 
* Finally, the network administrator business network card must be imported for use, 
* and the network can then be pinged to check it is responding.
